This project Handles comunications between the app and the database.
====================================================================

Entity framework core is the ORM in use plus Identity for user account handling.

All the entities ie the database tables are given Guids (SQL unique Identifier) to identify each row.
Has the advantage that a trip to the database is not needed to collect a 
row ID for a new table row to be created. 

Table properties are set by fluent api and not data annotations as I don't like cluttering up the classes.
Date and time values are stored in a string , format "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.xxx" unless there is a good reason not to.





NuGet Packages installed
Microsoft SQL Server database provider for Entity Framework Core. 3.1.3

// connection string is in secrets.json file in project WebUI, select the "manage secrets" in 
the project drop down menu.


Database creation commands for the development system 
=====================================================

Note need to setup entity framework in  the web project before running these commands.
EF needs to know configuration data only held there. 

migration command
 add-migration  <migration name> -StartupProject Web -Project Data
 Update-Database -StartupProject Web


 scafold from an existing database 
====================================
note this scafold command takse database from the localdb and generates a context "DBContext" 
to represent the database. Does not have any access details for any other database as this 
file will be in source control.
 


  Scaffold-DbContext "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=App02;Trusted_Connection=True" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Model -Context "DBContext"
